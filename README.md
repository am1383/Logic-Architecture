## Overview
This project includes the implementation and testing of a basic 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) and a cascaded multiplexer (MUX2) in VHDL. The MUX entity is a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer, while the MUX2 entity uses the MUX component to create a more complex multiplexer structure. A testbench is provided to verify the functionality of both MUX and MUX2.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

MUX.vhd: VHDL code for the basic 2-to-1 multiplexer.
MUX2.vhd: VHDL code for the cascaded multiplexer using the MUX component.
MUX2_tb.vhd: Testbench for verifying the functionality of both MUX and MUX2
